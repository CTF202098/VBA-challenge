Data Bootcamp Week 2 HW - VBA

1.	The first thing I did was save alphabetical_testing as an XLSM so that I could use macro script. All of my VBA scripts were written for that file, then copied over into the Multiple_year_stock_data file. I have included the VSCode file I used as well. 
2.	Most of my code was written out in VSCode, then copied in to VBA, as I find that the VSCode interface makes it easier to visualize code logic. 
3.	The next thing I did was copy pseudo-code from Professor Booth’s instructor provided solution in order to guide my coding activity. Where I added my own pseudo-code, I noted as such. 
4.	For consistency, I used “ws.cells()” location method rather than range. In many cases, this led to my code being identical (sans variables) to Professor Booth’s code.
5.	Where code was copied directly from Professor Booth’s example, I have notated with pseudo code in VBA. With that being said, it must be stated that all of my overall code logic was mimicked from the example work the Professor Booth provided. For the most part, the functions that I used do not deviate from those used by Professor Booth, with the notable exception of the “Else If” function I used when creating my second leaderboard. I did use Professor Booth’s “reset” sub routine verbatim for clearing my workbook to try new code iterations.
